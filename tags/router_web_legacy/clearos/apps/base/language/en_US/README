// CodeIgniter Translations
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A lot of translations (200+) are found in CodeIgniter, but we don't use
that many yet.  We maintain a much smaller list here (translating is
already hard enough!). 

base_framework_lang.php contains the list of tags that need translating via 
the translation server.  This is done via a mapping to an entry in base_lang.
